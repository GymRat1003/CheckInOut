# CheckInOut
Motivation:
People would ask what time I would be home or what time did I leave home on several occasions.
So I thought what better way to visualize this small but meaningful process than by creating a PHP application that serves this purpose.

Disclaimer:
This app was created with the main intention to do check in/out, as well as other features.
There are some codes in some files for other earlier planned features, such as modifying or deleting a user's history, but it is unfinished. Might work on it in the future/a feature update.

Prequisites:
1. Change ConnectionManager.php to your hosted database. Originally built on MySQL with MySQL Workbench

2. Launch login.php to access features. To create Admin Account, use code 'abc123' or change SQL file accordingly
