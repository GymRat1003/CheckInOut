# CheckInOut
Motivation:
Sometimes I would need to find out what time I left home or reached home on several occasions.
So I had the idea to track this small but meaningful process, by creating a PHP application.

Disclaimer:
This app was created with the main intention to do check in/out, as well as other features.
There are some codes in some files for other earlier planned features, such as modifying or deleting a user's history, but it is unfinished. Might work on it in the future/a feature update.

Prequisites:
1. Change ConnectionManager.php to your hosted database. Originally built on MySQL with MySQL Workbench

2. Launch login.php to access features. To create Admin Account, use code 'abc123' or change SQL file accordingly
